    "In a list, each node has up to one successor. In a *binary tree*, each node has up to two children - left and right. Other relevant definitions:\n",
    "- **Leaf:** A tree node with no children\n",
    "- **Internal Node:** A node with at least one child\n",
    "- **Parent:** A node with a child is that child node's parent.\n",
    "- **Ancestor:** A node's parent, and all other parents up to the root.\n",
    "- **Root:** The one tree node with no parent (top node)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terms\n",
    "- **Edge:** Link from a node to a child.\n",
    "- **Depth:** Number of edges on the path from root to node. Root node has depth 0.\n",
    "- **Level:** All nodes with the same depth.\n",
    "- **Height:** Tree property. Determined by largest depth of any node. Tree with one node has height = 0.\n",

    "- **Full Binary Tree:** If every node contains 0 or 2 children\n",
    "- **Complete Binary Tree:** If all levels, except last, contain all possible nodes and all nodes in last level are as far left as possible.\n",
    "- **Perfect Binary Tree:** If all internal nodes have 2 children and all leaf nodes are at same level"
